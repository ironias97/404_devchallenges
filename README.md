<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

-I made this webpage for reinforce my knowledge on web developement, at the begining was a little hard to remember how to do the structure but looking at the right place I found a lot of information for how to build the page.
In this little projectI improve my skills at managing the dom elements and I learn how to import fonts at my webapp.
I hope to keep getting better on this programming area.
